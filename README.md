## Description

The game is a Frogger clone, it recreates the classic arcade game Frogger by rendering a number of characters to the game like player, enemies and collectable items. The user navigates the player across the board from the bottom to its top while crossing a road in between and avoiding enemies moving along the road with varying speeds. The game resets to its initial state when the player is hit by one of the enemies, or, when the player succeeds to reach the top.
